	<h1>About InStock Companies</h1>
	
	<p>InStock began operations in 2004 with offices in Franklin, TN and have since added personnel and capabilities that allow us to serve hundreds of customers and more than one billion dollars in retail sales annually. Our staff includes former retail buyers, big box national account managers, and many other personnel with industry and non-industry skill sets. We have spent the last few years leveraging this business experience with an in house development department resulting in products that are unique to retail in both their customization and power to drive sales.</p>
	
	<h3>Meeting Sales Goals</h3>
	
	<p>Meeting sales goals in retail is quite the task, especially for multi-thousand unit retail chains and their suppliers. Key personnel and departments are often responsible for multi-million dollar budgets that include the shipping of hundreds of items to thousands of locations. InStock products and services are specifically crafted to facilitate these operations and are designed to drive sales volume, profit and market share.</p>
			
	<h3>Proactive Retailing</h3>
	
	<p>It is our experience that the most successful companies are those that embrace a culture of proactive planning and execution. Alternatively, companies whose time is spent reacting to daily events tend to repeat mistakes and underperform. Based on this philosophy of proactive retailing we focus on solutions that will improve the quality of your team's decisions, create consistency in the results they attain and drive significant ROI through the processes integrated into all our products and services.</p>
	
	<h3>Technologies</h3>
	
	<p>InStock products range in form from Windows&#8482; based software, to "Cloud" driven products along with Mobile iOS&#8482; and Android&#8482; applications. The result is the ability for InStock Companies&#8482; to offer its customers products that work today and at the same time prepare them for the technology requirements of the future. These are the results we are most proud of as they create and capture business opportunities that deliver tangible profits for our customers every day.</p>
